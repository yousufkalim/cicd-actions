# ---------------- Developed by Yousuf Kalim - MERN TL ---------------- #
# This workflow is a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for deploying a React.js frontend application
# to a remote ubuntu server.
#
# Here are some comments to make it easier for everyone to use:
#
# 1. The workflow uses environment variables to set the application name, component name, and release path.
#    Ensure that these are set correctly according to your application's configuration.
#
# 2. The workflow runs on a push to the main branch and can be manually triggered with inputs to specify the target environment.
#
# 3. It's important to note that this workflow uses repository environment and several secrets and variables that need to be set up
#    in order for it to work properly. You will need to create the following secrets in your repository environment:
#
#    3.1. REMOTE_SERVER: the IP address or domain name of the remote server you are deploying to.
#    3.2. REMOTE_USER: the username you use to SSH into the remote server (root user is recommended).
#    3.3. REMOTE_KEY: the SSH private key you use to authenticate with the remote server.
#    3.4. NGINX_CONFIG: the contents of your NGINX configuration file. This should be a multi-line string with each line
#         separated by a newline character.
#
# In addition, you will need to set up the following variables in your repository environment:
#
#    3.5. APP_NAME: the name of the project without spaces.
#    3.6. COMPONENT_NAME: the name of the app component e.g: frontend, admin, backend.
#
# Overall, this workflow provides a good starting point for deploying a React.js frontend application to a remote server using GitHub Actions.
# However, it should be customized according to your application's specific requirements.
